# Asset Particle Disintegration Prototype

## Project Description
This is an **Asset Particle Disintegration Prototype** inspired by [Mathis Biabiany](https://mathis-biabiany.fr/), built entirely from scratch by **Anusheel Soni**. The project features a **dynamic particle-based disintegration effect** on an asset when interacted with the mouse.

## Features
- **Opposite directional movement** of the asset when the mouse moves.
- **Disintegration effect**:
  - Holding the left mouse button over the asset causes **fragmentation into pixels** within a defined radius.
  - The fragmented pixels move randomly but remain within the radius.
  - The effect is temporary and restores when the button is released.
- **Sprite-based effect application** with seamless integration.
- **Camera movement system** with modular damping presets.
- **Mouse-driven sprite movement** with a responsive control system.
- **Real-time restoration** of the sprite when the cursor moves away from an affected portion.

## Unity Version
This project was developed using **Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1)**.

## Project Structure
The repository contains only three folders:
- `Assets`

Anyone can clone this repository and open it directly in Unity 6 to try out the project.
